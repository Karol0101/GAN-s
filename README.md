# GAN-s
Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs, are a deep-learning-based generative model. 
More generally, GANs are a model architecture for training a generative model, and it is most common to use deep learning models in this architecture. 
The GAN architecture was ﬁrst described in the 2014 paper by Ian Goodfellow, et al. titled Generative Adversarial Networks. 
The initial models worked but where unstable and diﬃcult to train.
A standardized approach called Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks, or DCGAN, that led to more stable models was later formalized by Alec Radford, et al. in
the 2015 paper titled Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks.

The GAN model architecture involves two sub-models: a generator model for generating new examples and a discriminator model for classifying whether generated examples are 
real (from the domain) or fake (generated by the generator model):::

1. Generator. Model that is used to generate new plausible examples from the problem domain.
2. Discriminator. Model that is used to classify examples as real (from the domain) or fake (generated
